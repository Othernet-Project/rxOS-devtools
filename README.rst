This repository contains a `Buildroot <http://buildroot.org/>`_-based build
that creates an overlay image for `rxOS
<https://github.com/Outernet-Project/rxOS/>`_. It also serves as an example and
skeleton for building similar overlays.

The delete list
===============

The delete list is a file that contains paths that should not be part of the
overlay. Normally this list is generated from a rootfs tarball generated by the
rxOS build itself. This file is named ``delete_list.txt`` and placed in
``overlay/configs`` directory. If you wish to override any of the files in the
base rootfs, you can simply omit those files from the ``delete_list.txt``.

Output overlay name
===================

The overlay name can be set using the "User-provided options > Overlay name"
configuration option in the Buildroot menu.
